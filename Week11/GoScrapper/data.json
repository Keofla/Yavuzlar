It was addressed  by Progress Software back in February 2024 .  \"Progress Kemp LoadMaster contains an OS command injection vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the system through the LoadMaster management interface, enabling arbitrary system command execution,\" the agency said.   Rhino Security Labs, which discovered  and reported the flaw, said  successful exploitation enables command execution on LoadMaster should an attacker have access to the administrator web user interface, granting them full access to the load balancer.

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new stealthy malware loader called BabbleLoader that has been observed in the wild delivering information stealer families such as WhiteSnake  and Meduza .  BabbleLoader is an \"extremely evasive loader, packed with defensive mechanisms, that is designed to bypass antivirus and sandbox environments to deliver stealers into memory,\" Intezer security researcher Ryan Robinson said  in a report published Sunday.  Evidence shows that the loader is being used in several campaigns targeting both English and Russian-speaking individuals, primarily singling out users looking for generic cracked software as well as business professionals in finance and administration by passing it off as accounting software.   Loaders have become an increasingly prevalent method to deliver malware, like stealers or ransomware, often acting as the first stage in an attack chain in a manner that sidesteps traditional antivirus defenses by incorporating a be According to research from GitGuardian and CyberArk, 79% of IT decision-makers reported having experienced a secrets leak , up from 75% in the previous year's report. At the same time, the number of leaked credentials has never been higher, with over 12.7 million hardcoded credentials in public GitHub repositories alone . One of the more troubling aspects of this report is that over 90% of valid secrets found and reported remained valid for more than 5 days.  According to the same research, on average, it takes organizations 27 days  to remediate leaked credentials. Combine that with the fact that non-human identities outnumber human identities by at least 45:1 , and it is easy to see why many organizations are realizing stopping secrets sprawl means finding a way to deal with this machine identity crisis. Unfortunately, the research also shows that many teams are confused about who owns the security of these identities. It is a perfect storm of risk.   Why Does Rotation Take So L  What do hijacked websites, fake job offers, and sneaky ransomware have in common? They're proof that cybercriminals are finding smarter, sneakier ways to exploit both systems and people.  This week makes one thing clear: no system, no person, no organization is truly off-limits. Attackers are getting smarter, faster, and more creative—using everything from human trust to hidden flaws in technology. The real question is: are you ready?  💪 Every attack holds a lesson, and every lesson is an opportunity to strengthen your defenses. This isn't just news—it's your guide to staying safe in a world where cyber threats are everywhere. Let's dive in.  ⚡ Threat of the Week  Palo Alto Networks Warns of Zero-Day: A remote code execution flaw in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewall management interface is the newest zero-day to be actively exploited  in the wild. The company began warning about potential exploitation concerns on November 8, 2024. It has since been confirmed that it has been we Google appears to be readying a new feature called Shielded Email that allows users to create email aliases when signing up for online services and better combat spam.  The feature was first reported  by Android Authority last week following a teardown of the latest version of Google Play Services  for Android.  The idea is to create unique, single-use email addresses that forward the messages to the associated primary account, thereby preventing the need for providing the real email address when filling out forms or registering for new services online.   The idea of email aliases for improved privacy is not new. Back in 2021, Apple introduced  a similar feature called Hide My Email that allows iCloud+ subscribers to generate  random burner email addresses. It can also be used to set up new ones in Safari, Mail, and Apple Pay wherever email addresses are required.  Other providers like Bitwarden  and DuckDuckGo  have since also released an analogous feature. It's worth noting that IT leaders know the drill—regulators and cyber insurers demand regular network penetration testing  to keep the bad guys out. But here's the thing: hackers don't wait around for compliance schedules.  Most companies approach network penetration testing on a set schedule, with the most common frequency being twice a year (29%), followed by three to four times per year (23%) and once per year (20%), according to the Kaseya Cybersecurity Survey Report 2024 . Compliance-focused testing can catch vulnerabilities that exist at the exact time of testing, but it's not enough to stay ahead of attackers in a meaningful way.  Why More Frequent Testing Makes Sense  When companies test more often, they're not just checking a box for compliance—they're actually protecting their networks. The Kaseya survey also points out that the top drivers for network penetration testing are:   Cybersecurity Control and Validation (34%)  – ensuring the security controls work and vulnerabilities are minimized.  Re A new phishing campaign is targeting e-commerce shoppers in Europe and the United States with bogus pages that mimic legitimate brands with the goal of stealing their personal information ahead of the Black Friday shopping season.  \"The campaign leveraged the heightened online shopping activity in November, the peak season for Black Friday discounts. The threat actor used fake discounted products as phishing lures to deceive victims into providing their Cardholder Data (CHD) and Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII),\" EclecticIQ said .  The activity, first observed in early October 2024, has been attributed with high confidence to a Chinese financially motivated threat actor codenamed SilkSpecter. Some of the impersonated brands include IKEA, L.L.Bean, North Face, and Wayfare.

They also show that NSO Group repeatedly found ways to install the invasive surveillance tool on the target's devices as WhatsApp erected new defenses to counter the threat.  In May 2019, WhatsApp said it blocked a sophisticated cyber attack that exploited its video calling system to deliver Pegasus malware surreptitiously.

When attackers compromise a non-human identity (NHI), they can swiftly exploit it to move laterally across systems, identifying vulnerabilities and compromising additional NHIs in minutes. While organizations often take months to detect and contain such breaches, rapid detection and response can stop an attack in its tracks.  The Rise of Non-Human Identities in Cybersecurity  By 2025, non-human identities  will rise to be the primary attack vector in cybersecurity. As businesses increasingly automate processes and adopt AI and IoT technologies, the number of NHIs grows exponentially. While these systems drive efficiency, they also create an expanded attack surface for cybercriminals.  NHIs differ fundamentally from human users, making traditional security tools like multi-factor authentication and user behavior Multiple decade-old security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the needrestart package installed by default in Ubuntu Server (since version 21.04) that could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges without requiring user interaction.  The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), which identified and reported  the flaws early last month, said they are trivial to exploit, necessitating that users move quickly to apply the fixes. The vulnerabilities are believed to have existed since the introduction of interpreter support in needrestart 0.8 , which was released on April 27, 2014.  \"These needrestart exploits allow Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) which means that a local attacker is able to gain root privileges,\" Ubuntu said  in an advisory, noting they have been addressed in version 3.8. \"The vulnerabilities affect Debian, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions.\"  Needrestart is a utility that scans a system to determine the services that need to be restarted aSee where vendors and tools aren't owning accountability and how SOCs are shifting strategies.

The idea, the tech giant said, is to avoid incidents  like that of CrowdStrike's earlier this July, enable more apps and users to be run without admin privileges, add controls surrounding the use of unsafe apps and drivers, and offer options to encrypt personal data.  One of the most important features is Quick Machine Recovery  that's expected to be available to the Windows Insider Program community in early 2025.  \"This feature will enable IT administrators to execute targeted fixes from Windows Update on PCs, even when machines are unable to boot, without needing physical access to the PC,\" David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, said . \"This remote recovery will unblock your employees from broad issues much faster than what has been possible in the past.\"  A new China-linked cyber espionage group has been attributed as behind a series of targeted cyber attacks targeting telecommunications entities in South Asia and Africa since at least 2020 with the goal of enabling intelligence collection.

However, many organizations focus solely on managing privileged access—rather than securing the accounts and users entrusted with it. This emphasis is perhaps due to the persistent challenges of Privileged Access Management (PAM)  deployments. Yet, as the threat landscape evolves, so must organizational priorities. To prevent trust from becoming a liability, the next step in securing privileged access must become a critical focus.  In this blog, we explore why managing privileged access alone is insufficient and provide actionable insights to help you craft a security-first strategy for privileged access.  The Evolution of PAM  Privileged Access Management (PAM) has long been a cornerstone of securing an organization's privileged users  and critical resources.

The Anthem Awards honor mission-driven individuals, companies and organizations worldwide, inspiring global change.\n\n\n\nRead Norman’s submission essay, “Scanning the Past to Empower the Future.” Learn more about the award.\n\n\n\nNorman began volunteering with Internet Archive’s Open Library in 2019, where the Tennessee native took on a variety of responsibilities, including the communications lead in Open Library’s Fellowship program. Now he is a digital technician, assisting on a variety of digitization projects. He has scanned documents from the University of California Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies Library, the Graduate Theological Union and others.\n\n\n\nMaking vital documents available to the public is a privilege, he said, and provides important clues about the past that can inform future decisions.\n\n\n\n“It’s like breadcrumbs,” Norman said of the knowledge he helps share with users. “Each piece we scan is a breadcrumb, a fragment of a story. People can pick them up, follow the trail, and discover something meaningful — and that’s what I want to do: help people pick them up and see where they lead.”\n\n\n\nNorman, whose parents are both librarians, said he was drawn to the work because of his interest in learning and commitment to accessibility of knowledge for all.\n\n\n\n“I think about all the materials out there that we get to touch through digitization,” Norman said. “The ability to make significant change or have a profound impact is right at our fingertips.”\n\n\n\nNorman considers the documents he has digitized through the course of his work. Some of the materials were given out at meetings or in boardrooms and filed away for safekeeping in places out of reach. He says digitization cracks the knowledge in these materials open again and ushers in new potential.  \n\n\n\n“It simply takes pulling up a chair at the computer, looking at [the materials] and seeing how I can harness or leverage this to fill in gaps of information that people didn’t even know was out there,” Norman said. “We’re doing something that can make the world a better place.”\n\n\n\nNorman hopes the award shines a spotlight on the Internet Archive’s mission to make knowledge accessible to all, adding: “My goal is to use my expertise in community engagement and building partnerships to draw attention to meaningful work, such as what we’re doing here.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Wayback Machine, Archive.org, Archive-it.org, and OpenLibrary.org came up in stages over the week after cyberattacks with some of the contributor features coming up over the last couple of weeks.  A few to go.  Much of the development during this time has been focused on securing the services so they can still run while attacks continue.  \n\n\n\nThe Internet Archive is adapting to a more hostile world, where DDOS attacks are recurring periodically (such as yesterday and today), and more severe attacks might happen. Our response has been to harden our services and learn from friends. This note is to share some high level findings, without being so detailed as to help those that are still attacking archive.org.\n\n\n\nBy tightening firewall technologies, we have changed how data flows through our systems to improve monitoring and control. The downside is these upgrades have forced changes to software, some of it quite old. \n\n\n\nThe bright side is this is forcing upgrades that we have long planned or hoped for.  We are greatly helped by the free and open source community’s improving tools that can be used by large corporations as well as non-profit libraries because they are freely available.\n\n\n\nAlso, some commercial companies have offered assistance that would generally be prohibitively expensive.  We are grateful for the support.\n\n\n\nWhere the Internet Archive has always focused on building collections and preserving them, we have been starkly reminded how important reliable access is to researchers, journalists, and readers. This is leading us to install technical defenses and increase staff to improve service availability.\n\n\n\nLibraries in general, and the Internet Archive in specific, have been under attack for many years now.  For us it started with the book publishers suing (about lending books), and now the recording industry (about 78rpm records), which is a drain on our staff and financial resources. Now recurring DDOS attacks distract us from the goals of preservation and access to our digital heritage.We don’t know why these attacks have started recently and if they are coordinated, but we are building defenses.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful for the support from our patrons, through social media, through donations, and through offers of help, which frankly, makes it worthwhile to keep building a library for all of us.\n\n\n\n– Brewster Kahle\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe following guest post from researcher Amanda Gray Rendón is part of our Vanishing Culture series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age. Read more essays online or download the full report now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked to consider women’s care labor, people likely think about feminized gender roles within “the domestic sphere” where labor has historically been invisible and undervalued. For women of color, the lines between public and private have often been blurred, as evidenced by the family photo of my great-grandmother picking beets in a field while caring for my two-year-old grandmother. Sixty years later the roles would reverse and my grandmother would serve as the primary caregiver for her mother with Alzheimer’s dementia. I could not begin to quantify in dollars the thirteen years of 24/7 care she provided our family.\n\n\n\nIn U.S. culture, women have historically been thought of as “natural” caregivers or predisposed to caring for others, so little to no concern has been given to assigning monetary value to the labor that women are expected to perform.\n\n\n\nThis begs the question: how can we adequately archive a history that is designed to be hidden and undervalued precisely because of how invaluable it is to our social, cultural, and economic fabric? \n\n\n\nDownload the complete Vanishing Culture report.\n\n\nWomen’s care work—both paid and unpaid—serves as the foundation on which the world’s postindustrial economies have functioned. Working mothers and caregivers often participate in what scholars refer to as the “double-day,” or the “double shift.” This is when (predominantly) women have an income-earning day job followed by unpaid caregiving labor they provide their families when they get home in the evening after “work.” Some have argued women’s care work has expanded into a triple shift whereby women have taken on more caregiving roles within their communities, adding significantly to gendered burdens of care.\n\n\n\nThe invisible, and at times isolating, nature of care work contributes to the precarity of archiving women’s care labor history. To preserve this aspect of our cultural history, it’s vital to engage with those performing care work, as well as to understand the different ways that community care work is performed. Documenting caregiver culture on social media allows us to identify the contributions that caregivers and care communities make, along with the barriers they face.\n\n\n\nNo one has helped me to understand this more than Cynthia “Cindy Ann” Espinoza. Cindy Ann and I met when we both attended Metropolitan Community Church in San Antonio. She graciously offered to participate in my research when I spoke at a community education session on Alzheimer’s disease that the church sponsored in collaboration with the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association. We became Facebook friends shortly thereafter and I observed firsthand the virtual care work in which Cindy Ann participated, as well as the archive she had created of the “real world” care she provided her mother who passed from complications of Alzheimer’s dementia several years earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 17, 2017, about a week before PBS aired the documentary Alzheimer’s: Every Minute Counts, Cindy Ann posted a video excerpt from the film to her wall on Facebook. The three-minute video, with 4.4 million views and over 5,000 comments, was originally posted to Facebook by Next Avenue, a PBS digital publication dedicated to issues facing individuals over 50 years old in the United States. The documentary follows Daisy Duarte, a Latina in Minneapolis, as she cares for her mother, Sonja, who is living with early-onset Alzheimer’s dementia.\n\n\n\nNext Avenue’s original post reads, “Millions of Americans will be able to relate to this story.” Cindy Ann identified herself as one of those millions of Americans almost five years after her mother’s passing from complications of Alzheimer’s dementia. Her post included the message, “I can relate to this woman in this story. Its the hardest thing to see ur parent dealing with Alzheimer”s ..but i did it for 9 yrs caring for my Mom i have no regrets. I would do it all again even if she didn’t remember who i was. I love & miss you dearly Mommy..” Cindy Ann watched Daisy wash her mother’s clothes, brush her teeth, apply her makeup, do her hair, show her how to hold a spoon, sit her in a recliner to watch television—all while exclusively speaking Spanish. The invisible care work Cindy Ann provided her mother nearly a decade before was publicly visible for the world to see.\n\n\n\nI also related to the family portrayed in the film. As I viewed the video, I was reminded of my own experience helping my grandmother care for my great-grandmother when the three of us lived together in San Antonio. This personal connection prompted me to comment with a note of: “thanks for sharing.” I appreciated the connection Cindy Ann created in that moment.\n\n\n\nSeveral of her other Facebook friends left comments in response to her post. There was one from an employee at a local adult daycare facility: “Yup and ur mama was a beautiful blessing for us at seniors 2000! I loved her so much <3;” and another from a current caregiver, “Aww I’m doing it right now. My heart aches every time I leave my mom. I pray for her mind to heal. It’s one of the ugliest diseases ever encountered! I pray they find a cure very soon.” Others were comments of support, such as: “Super hard, girl.” and “Amen.” \n\n\n\nThe commenters were all women who either acknowledged Cindy Ann’s experience as their own or validated it with words of empathy and support. That winter morning, Cindy Ann’s public Facebook page was a place where women came together to share a commonality of experience in an online space.  The care community helped to make visible their friend’s caregiving labor, as well as their own—in effect becoming a part of care labor history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the internet seems to be “forever”, the ephemeral nature of certain online spaces—such as social media pages and posts that can be deleted or websites that are no longer supported—necessitates an archival space such as the Internet Archive, which on May 9, 2017 captured the full-length documentary Cindy Ann posted about. Nowhere else on the internet can I access this film without a subscription, rental, or purchase. As a researcher, the Wayback Machine is an invaluable archival research tool that I rely on to provide accurate records of historical online spaces I can no longer access. However, we must find a way to better preserve social media pages such as Facebook, Instagram, X, and others where caregivers post and provide community care. The sheer volume of pages and posts may have made this a challenging task previously, but with new AI language learning models, we can begin to conceive of ways to more pointedly target and capture the rich history of online care communities and women’s virtual care work.\n\n\n\nTo preserve a more complete and inclusive history of women’s caregiving labor, digital archivists must seek out the spaces where women are performing the work. The Internet Archive serves as a record that women’s care communities exist, have always existed, and will continue to exist. Documenting the challenges women caregivers face, the support they need, and their shared spaces of communal experience helps to create a more complete historical record of their cultural impact for future generations.\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nAmanda Gray Rendón is a community-based researcher, writer, oral historian, and documentary filmmaker.

We dreamed big: to inspire and re-energize people around the world, moving our community to take the actions needed for our times; building an archive of open-source knowledge about decentralized technologies, translating and transmitting our knowledge to many sectors beyond tech; and above all, we dreamed of supporting new global networks, building local capacities around the world through a truly decentralized approach.\n\n\n\nFast forward to today, and our community has come together for DWeb Camps in 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Over the years, more than 2000 campers have journeyed to Northern California to connect, learn, share, and play as we build better, more decentralized network technologies. What started as an event has formed an emerging movement — informed by a set of shared principles about how we shape the web. A web that actualizes principles of trust, human agency, mutual respect, and ecological awareness.\n\n\n\nDWeb Camp 2024 at Camp Navarro, California; photo by Brad Shirakawa\n\n\n\nBut, what’s next? Where should we put our energies in 2025?\n\n\n\nAfter community surveys, consultations, and much deep thought, the core organizers of DWeb Camp (myself, mai ishikawa sutton, Ese Ojo, Kev Nguyễn, ngoc trieu, Ian Davis, Iryna Nezhynska, Andi Wong, and Arkadiy Kukarkin, with input from Boris Mann and Will Howes) have decided that it is time to put put our energy into truly decentralizing DWeb. We want to nurture this movement in a way that empowers nodes around the world, especially those outside of the United States. We want to focus our energies in 2025 on helping local networks build capacity and grow.\n\n\n\nFrom the 2024 DWeb Camp Survey\n\n\n\nSo rather than host a DWeb Camp in Northern California in 2025, we will be using our resources to support regional events hosted by our DWeb partners.  Some of our early ideas and plans:\n\n\n\n\nRightsCon: February 24-27, 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan — A one-day DWeb event before the main conference, 50+ people with an Internet freedom focus. \n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Summit: May 27-30, 2025 in Vancouver, Canada — 100-200 people in downtown Vancouver, hosted by 221A and Internet Archive Canada / The Permanent, with a hackathon, talks/workshops, and art exhibits.\n\n\n\n\n\nDWeb Institute: Summer 2025 in San Francisco — A 5-day intensive workshop to bring together researchers and software developers to share insights and collaborate towards the sound and sustainable development of efficient eventually-consistent (offline-first) peer-to-peer systems. Led by the team that runs P2P Basel.\n\n\n\n\n\nBranding Workshop: Summer 2025, location TBD — A 5-day intensive on communications, branding, fundraising, and UX to help startups and bootstrappers reach the next level with their ready-to-use tech.\n\n\n\n\n\nDWeb Camp Brazil: November 2025 in Brazil, location TBD — a 5-day Camp for 100-200 people, primarily in Portuguese with a focus on regenerative agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we want to hear from you. How can the DWeb community help you reach the next level? What are your dreams, goals, and needs? What ideas do you have that need support? Come join us at our next virtual DWeb Meetup — What’s Next? An interactive discussion on Thursday, November 14 at 5 PM PT / 8pm ET, to discuss where the DWeb community should focus in the coming, surely tumultuous year. REGISTER HERE. \n\n\n\nThanks for caring, contributing, and helping us chart the course of the DWeb community.\n\n\n\nAnd mark your calendars: We’ll be back with another DWeb Camp in 2026!\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n“When you’re looking for something, it’s important to know who was in love” by Swilk\n\n\n\nSwilk, a queer Oakland-based weaver and installation artist, invites the community to the Internet Archive for a special show: an immersive art exhibit that breathes life into historic HIV artifacts. The piece, titled When you’re looking for something, it’s important to know who was in love, invites the public to connect the modern world to a history that was almost lost.\n\n\n\nThe Archive hosts thousands of historic HIV/AIDS documents and web resources in its collection. These weavings are programmed to respond whenever one of the resources compiled for this project are uploaded, downloaded, or saved. As the public interacts with this history, the motors fire, making the weaving breathe and pulse. Most of these resources, and the voices that filled them, have since been scrubbed, or altered off the internet.\n\n\n\nThe 80s and 90s were fraught with the suppression of lifesaving AIDS resources. When the internet became public, this all changed. Activists for the first time could distribute information without needing permission from distributors. Those isolated could find other people with a positive diagnosis and cope in community with one another. The internet played a critical role in HIV/AIDS activism, and as it slowly disappears from the world and the web, the Internet Archive has been instrumental in holding onto this history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwilk’s work highlights the importance of the modern world connecting with our queer history, and invites the audience to reflect on its relevance today. \n\n\n\n“I grew up queer in an environment that taught me that to have HIV was a death sentence. It took me years to find the queer history of the HIV epidemic. It took me longer to learn about options like PreP. The more I learned about my history, and those that came before me, the more at home I felt in myself. This history, and the actions of those that made it, have bolstered my safety in the world at large.”\n\n\n\nWhen you’re looking for something, it’s important to know who was in love will be shown in the Great Room, the Internet Archive’s repurposed chapel space, on November 9, 2024 from 7pm-9pm. The event is free and open to the public. Music and food provided.  Limited edition screen prints will be made at the reception, people are invited to bring paper and fabrics to print on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Swilk: \n\n\n\nSwilk is an Oakland-based weaver who has exhibited work around the world. They are a Genderqueer artist whose work centers queer history and the emotional experience of home. Their work has been exhibited and awarded in a number of spaces, including the CICA Museum in South Korea, Barcelona’s El Poblenou District, and a number of international artist residencies.

Community Webs advances the capacity of community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. \n\n\n\nAs a local history and genealogy department in a public library, our materials run the gamut from books from the 1700s about the creation of our country to yearbooks of local high schools that patrons like to peruse for nostalgia’s sake. In addition to our approximately 90,000 reference books, our archives room holds approximately 2,500 linear feet of photographic material, records, and manuscript material. We are constantly seeking new opportunities to expand access to our collections for our patrons, and when the opportunity arose to digitize materials as part of the Community Webs program, I knew what I wanted to digitize first: local neighborhood newspapers of Columbus.  \n\n\n\nOhio Columbian, February 24, 1853\n\n\n\nWe joined the Community Webs program in 2017 to archive important cultural and local government websites of Columbus, Ohio. The catalyst for the project was the belief that we had done a good job of telling the story of Columbus in its first 150 years, but we were missing telling the story of the evolution of the city of the more recent past, as well as failing to record the present. With the object of capturing more recent changes to our city, we focused on archiving our city government website, as well as archiving social service websites, especially those helping new immigrants in our city. Because of the Community Webs program, we were able to take a snapshot of the diverse populations that were making their homes in Columbus, and the medium of web archiving was the only way we were able to tell the stories of these new immigrant communities including the Somalian, Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Mexican populations. To further this focus on migration patterns into Columbus, we felt it was important to make our neighborhood newspapers that we had on microfilm accessible because the neighborhood newspapers featured stories and obituaries on immigrant populations who came to Columbus in the mid-19th century and early 20th century.\n\n\n\nThe newspapers had been preserved on microfilm for decades, but we were never able to digitize them due the time commitment involved for a project that size. During my time in the local history field in Columbus, it has become clear to me that our library patrons crave hyper-local history material that personally connects their stories to the place they live. While general local history topics about Columbus are popular, nothing is more popular in our library than content generated from Columbus neighborhoods. To finally get an opportunity to digitize neighborhood newspapers and make them accessible to our patrons was one that I could not pass up.\n\n\n\nColumbus Call and Post, May 3, 1975\n\n\n\nThe most important newspaper for the library to digitize was the Columbus Call and Post, a historic Black newspaper that served Columbus from 1962-2007. For years patrons have asked us if the newspaper was digitized, but unfortunately all the library had was microfilm starting in 1972, which was very difficult to browse and ultimately did not serve our patron’s needs for accessibility. Because the Internet Archive performed optical character recognition (OCR) on the text of the newspapers, researchers can now use keyword searching to find an address, a business name, or search for personal names to find news stories that mention the people and places that they hold in their memory.\n\n\n\nDigitizing the microfilm of the Call and Post also complemented another project we began several years ago when we partnered with the King Arts Complex to digitize the photograph archive of the iconic newspaper, which was donated to the organization in the mid-1990s. Many of the photographs in the collection have little to no information attached to them (information written on the back of the photographic prints, the name of the photographer, etc.). Digitization of the Call and Post provided additional information to match and apply to the photographs in the archive, adding an enhanced level of searchability and accessibility to this collection. The collections work together to preserve Black history in a way that was not possible before because much of the content from the Call and Post was unique and rare. Being able to bring this newspaper back into the public consciousness has been a thrilling experience for us.\n\n\n\nCongressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in Columbus, Columbus Call and Post Photograph Collection\n\n\nAs the project continued to take shape, we felt it was important to represent Columbus neighborhoods geographically, which also enabled us to represent different economic and ethnically diverse communities throughout Columbus history. Our most accessed newspaper thus far has been the Hilltop Record,  a title which focused on a local neighborhood with strong Appalachian ties and has a long history of covering the issues of working-class citizens on the westside of Columbus. Other digitized community newspapers include :\n\n\n\n· The Eastern Spectator and Eastern Review offers perspectives from the city’s Jewish community.\n\n\n\n· The Southside Booster and Southside Leader, shares the industrial and union history of Columbus.\n\n\n\n· The Linden NE News showcases stories from north Columbus, an area that has experienced several demographic shifts throughout its 100 years of history.\n\n\n\nHilltop Record, November 8, 1928\n\n\n\nThe rarest newspapers digitized for this project were also some of the oldest newspapers that were preserved on microfilm in our collection. Among those titles are the  Ohio Columbian (1853-1856), an anti-slavery newspaper that reported on Underground Railroad activities as they were happening in Ohio and surrounding states. It has potential for illuminating our understanding and knowledge of individuals that were involved in assisting enslaved people seeking freedom in the 1850s.  Other newspapers with great research potential include early (and shorter) runs of Black newspapers that have not been digitized before this project including  The Columbus Recorder (1927), The Columbus Voice (1929), which was edited by Florence W. Oakfield, and The Ohio Torch (1928-1930), the longest running newspaper for the Black community during the 1920s. We are excited to report that researchers are already using these resources to better understand Columbus history more objectively and completely.\n\n\n\nWith this support from the Internet Archive and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, we have been able to help our local users find information that was not available elsewhere. Recently, we had a researcher request an obituary from June of 1964 when our two major newspapers were on strike. Thankfully, the South Side Spectator had been digitized and was available through the Internet Archive. Our librarian was able to locate the obituary that was only available in that newspaper. We also got this enthusiastic email from a regular library patron after we informed them that we had digitized the Hilltop Record and it was now keyword searchable on the Internet Archive: “OH MY GOSH! ARE YOU SERIOUS!?! THAT’S FANTASTIC! Have I told you lately how much I love you guys? You rock my world! Thank you so much for everything you do. I am so grateful for everyone in Local History & Genealogy.”\n\n\n\nMoreover, the librarians are using the digitized newspapers in regular programming, furthering our promotion of these new digitized collections. Every month the library hosts a virtual Black Heritage Collection Spotlight on a notable person or topic from Black history in Columbus. The images and news articles from the digitized Call and Post are used frequently for the program, and we look forward to learning about more ways the digitized newspapers are used in local research to highlight and deepen our community’s connections to Columbus’ past. \n\n\n\nBrowse the Columbus Neighborhood Newspapers Collection on archive.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet Archive and Community Webs are thankful for the support from the National Historical Publications & Records Commission for Collaborative Access to Diverse Public Library Local History Collections, which will digitize and provide access to a diverse range of local history archives that represent the experiences of immigrant, indigenous, and African American communities throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe following Q&A between writer Caralee Adams and journalist Philip Bump of The Washington Post is part of our Vanishing Culture series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age. Read more essays online or download the full report now.\n\n\n\nPhilip Bump is a columnist for The Washington Post based in New York. He writes the weekly newsletter How To Read This Chart. He’s also the author of The Aftermath: The Last Days of the Baby Boom and the Future of Power in America.\n\n\n\nCaralee Adams: What does it mean for an individual journalist to have their work preserved? Why is it important to have easy access to news stories from the past?\n\n\n\nPhilip Bump: One of the nice things about my career has been that I’ve worked for outlets that I feel confident are doing their own preservation, like The Washington Post. I’m not particularly worried about losing access to my writing. However, it’s less of a concern for me than it is for other outlets, unfortunately. It is unquestionably the case that I find the Internet Archive useful and use it regularly for a variety of things—both for its preservation of online content and collection of closed captioning for news programs.\n\n\n\nAny recent examples of when you’ve found the Internet Archive particularly useful?\n\n\n\nI use the search tool on closed captioning more than anything else. The other day I was trying to find an old copy of a webpage. I was writing about Donald Trump’s comments on Medal of Honor recipients. As it turns out, there is not an immediately accessible resource for when Medals of Honor were granted to members of the military. You can see aggregated—how many there are—but you can’t see who was given a medal and when they served. I actually used the Internet Archive to see how the metrics changed between the beginning of Trump’s presidency and by the end of it. I was able to see that there were medals awarded to about 11 people who served during the War on Terror, three who served in Vietnam, and one during World War II. Then, I was able to go back and double check against the Trump White House archive, which is done by the National Archives, and see the people to whom he had given this award. That’s a good example of being able to take those two snapshots in time and then compare them in order to see what the difference was to get this problem solved.\n\n\n\nWhy is it important for the public to have free public access to an archive of the news for television or print?\n\n\n\nIt’s the same reason that it’s important, in general, to have any sort of archive: it increases accountability and increases historical accuracy. The Internet Archive is essential at ensuring that we have an understanding of what was happening on the internet at a given point in time. That is not something that is constantly useful, but it is something that is occasionally extremely useful. I do a lot of work in politics and get to see what people are saying at certain points in time, which are important checks and accountability for elected officials.  The public can know what they were saying when they were running in the primary as compared with the general [election]. The Archive allows anyone to be able to get information from websites that are no longer active. If you’re looking for something and you have the old link to Gawker or the old link to a tweet, you can often [find] it archived.  The Internet Archive doesn’t capture everything—it couldn’t possibly do so. But it captures enough to generally answer the questions that need to get answered. There’s nowhere else that does that. There are other archiving sites, but none that do so as comprehensively, or none with an archive that goes back that far.\n\n\n\nDownload the full Vanishing Culture report.\n\n\n\nHas any of your journalism vanished from the public? Do you have any examples where you’ve been looking for something and it’s been missing?\n\n\n\nYes. One of the challenges is that multimedia content has often, in the past, been overlooked. There are old news reports that I’ve been unable to find because they’re on video in the era before there was a lot of accessibility and transcripts. Therefore, yes, there are certainly things like that which come up with some regularity. Also, particularly in the era of 2005 to 2015, there were a lot of independent sites that had useful news reports—particularly since we’re talking about the cast of political characters that have been around in the public eye at that point in time. It’s often the case that it’s hard to track those things down. Or if you’re trying to track down the original source or verify a rumor, you might need to dip into the Archive. There are a lot of sites from that era of “bespoke” blogs that the Internet Archive often captures. \n\n\n\nHow does limited access to historical data or previous coverage impact you as a journalist?\n\n\n\nIt is hard to say, because relatively speaking, I am advantaged by the fact that I live in this era.  If I were doing this in 1990, [I’d use] basically whatever was at the New York Public Library and on microfiche. It is far better than it used to be, but the amount of content being produced is also far larger. It is both a positive and a negative that it is far easier to do that sort of research here from my desk at home than it would possibly have been 30 years ago. In fact, I was working on a project where I relied heavily on a local newspaper in a small town in Pennsylvania that wasn’t available online. I literally had to hire someone in the town to go to the library, find [coverage from] the particular date and the local paper and to get the scans done. It cost me hundreds of dollars, but that was the only way to do it. You can see how getting these things done is problematic and challenging.\n\n\n\nWhen Paramount deleted the MTV News Archive in June, there was a lot of dismay, but some say it was frivolous, disposable, and kind of meant to be thrown away. How do you feel about that?\n\n\n\nMy first writing gig online was at MTV News in college, so that actually had a personal resonance for me. I was at Ohio State in the early to mid 1990s, and I got this little internship with MTV News. I wrote one piece about this band called The Hairy Patt Band. It ended up on the MTV News website. I was very excited. I haven’t seen that in 30 years. It’s one of those things where I wondered what ever happened to that story or if it exists anywhere, in any form. So, that [news] actually had resonance. It’s a bummer. Is it as important to maintain the archives of MTV News as it is The Washington Post? I’m biased, but I would say, no. But it is still a loss of culture—and it is a unique loss of culture. This was a unique and novel form of information that was emergent in the 1990s and now is lost. In the moment, its very existence captured the culture in a way that is worth preserving.\n\n\n\nHow do you feel about the future of digital preservation of news, data, and information?\n\n\n\nI’m more pessimistic than I used to be. I came of age with the internet. When it was new, I used to describe it as the emergence from a new dark age. We had all this information and there was no more going back. All this existed. Everything was online, and we had archives. Now, we see, in part because the scale has increased so quickly that economic considerations come into play, and all of a sudden… the internet isn’t just an endless archive anymore. There are very few places that are doing what libraries do to capture these things on microfiche or store books for the public’s benefit. There is so much of it and that becomes the problem.\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to pay attention to this issue and preserve journalism for future reporters?\n\n\n\nIt is obviously the case that we are creating information, culture, and benchmarks for society faster than we can figure out how we’re going to make sure they’re preserved. I think that’s probably always been the case, except that what’s different now is that we are more cognizant of the process of preservation and the challenges of preservation. We expect there to be this thing that exists forever. We don’t yet know how to balance the interest in having as few things be ephemeral as possible, versus the value in doing that… maybe it’s not even possible to preserve everything in the way that we would want to at scale. We have created a process by which it is possible to record and observe nearly everything, and now we’re realizing that that is potentially in conflict with our desire to also store and preserve all this information indefinitely.\n\n\n\nAnything you’d like to add?\n\n\n\nI think it’s worth noting that preservation is one of the few areas in which I think artificial intelligence bears some potential benefit. One of the things that I’ve long found frustrating is that The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other major news outlets, have enormous storehouses of information—not all of it textual. The New York Times must have, in its archives, photos of every square inch of New York City at some point in time over the course of the past 100 years. Artificial intelligence is a great tool for indexing and documenting. We now have tools that allow us to go deeper into our archives and extract more information from them, which I think is a positive development, and is something I’ve advocated for a long time publicly. Only with the advent of artificial intelligence does large-scale preservation become something that seems feasible. One can go through the National Archive and extract an enormous amount of information that is currently stored there in an accessible form, which saves someone from having to stumble upon a particular image. I think that is beneficial. I don’t think that necessarily solves the storage at scale issue, but it does address the fact that so much information is currently locked away and inaccessible, which is another facet of the challenge.  \n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nCaralee Adams is a journalist based in Bethesda, Maryland.

The Internet Archive is carrying on that tradition by hosting in-person gatherings at its Funston Avenue headquarters in San Francisco, including candidate forums and public interest events.\n\n\n\n“Our goal is to connect with folks who are related to the mission: the universal access to all knowledge,” said Even Sirchuk, community and events manager for the Archive.\n\n\n\nThis fall, the Internet Archive opened its doors to the League of Women Voters, the ACLU, Mission Local, and SFGovTV to hold forums with candidates for the San Francisco District 1 Board of Supervisors, San Francisco sheriff and an event on politics and money, explaining the funders behind propositions on the California ballot in the November election.\n\n\n\n“It’s great to have a funky building that can host us. And it introduces people to a venue or service they might not actually have been exposed to—educating people on what the Internet Archive does.”Danielle Diebler, volunteer for the League of Women Voters of San Francisco\n\n\n\nAt a moment when the public is seeking information and connection, libraries are institutions that provide access to resources, programs and public spaces for all members of a community, according to the American Library Association (ALA). As one voter engagement PDF guide from ALA highlights, “Libraries are nonpartisan, but they are not indifferent.”\n\n\n\nThe Internet Archive wants its building to be more than space for books and servers—to also serve as a community resource, Sirchuk said. By opening its doors to nonprofits for free and providing needed tech support, organizations can host these events in person, which many could not otherwise afford to do.\n\n\n\nDanielle Diebler, a volunteer with the League of Women Voters of San Francisco for nearly a decade, said she was pleased to find the Internet Archive as a venue. It is conveniently located, near public transportation, outfitted with the technical support needed to live stream and record—and free to the nonprofit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s great to have a funky building that can host us,” Diebler said. “And it introduces people to a venue or service they might not actually have been exposed to—educating people on what the Internet Archive does.”\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Archive has been a resource to the League, helping digitize its historical documents.\n\n\n\nWith an in-person gathering, Diebler said, citizens have the opportunity to walk up to candidates and ask questions—something that is not possible over Zoom.\n\n\n\n“It’s such a big election this year with so much on the ballot,” she said. “It’s even more important to have accessible resources and understand where candidates stand on important issues.”\n\n\n\nEmily Capage, organization administrative associate with the ACLU in San Francisco, who partnered with the League on the forums, said it was important for voters to have a place to learn about the candidates.\n\n\n\n“People don’t often get to see them face to face. It’s our right to be able to learn and be educated,” she said. “Local politics matter. It affects our day-to-day lives more than larger national policies.”\n\n\n\nFor the money and politics event in October at the Internet Archive, Joe Rivano Barros was invited to speak. He is a senior editor of Mission Local, an independent news site based in the Mission District, and has been tracking who is funding the various ballot initiatives. “People just don’t know or get information from the campaign itself,” he said. “We shine more light on money and politics.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s something about an in-person event, where people make an effort to attend, that elevates the quality of the conversation, he said. “The Internet Archive is great because it’s vast and has the tech all set up,” Barros said. “They’ve been very generous.”\n\n\n\nIn the newsroom, Barros said he regularly taps into resources available through the Internet Archive, such as archived campaign websites, and he also submits materials to be preserved. “It’s a wonderful tool for journalists,” he added.\n\n\n\nSirchuk added that the Internet Archive is focused on preserving written knowledge, but it also values oral history. “That information doesn’t get spread if there isn’t a forum for that knowledge exchange,” he said. “And what’s cool about the forum as a format is that you can compare knowledge in real time, listen to four or five responses to see which connects with you and then do more research.”\n\n\n\nThe events at the Archive are recorded, backed up and added to the online collection for anyone to access at their convenience for free.\n\n\n\nAnson Ho, production supervisor for SFGovTV, live streamed and recorded the fall forums at the Archive building. He appreciated the good audio, lighting and infrastructure provided.\n\n\n\n“It’s such an amazing opportunity that they have the community space,” Ho said. “San Francisco is very dense and sometimes it’s hard to find public spaces that big to have people come and gather.”\n\n\n\nCapage of the ACLU added that, as a nonprofit operating on a tight budget, it’s hard to find affordable venues for events. She’s grateful to partner with the Internet Archive, she said, and hopes to use the facility again in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe following guest post from digital librarian Peter Scholing is part of our Vanishing Culture series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age.

For the people of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao (the ABC islands), Papiamento is not only their official language and their native tongue, but also a vital part of this identity. However, in today’s rapidly evolving online landscape, where access to English and Spanish language content is easier than ever before, small scale languages like Papiamento may be hard to find, and the traditional (oral, written, analog) methods of language preservation are no longer sufficient. \n\n\n\nThe Wind-Blown Language: Papiamento (1945) by Jerome Littmann\n\n\nThe preservation of Papiamento now relies on the strategic use of digital tools to capture, store, and make accessible the rich body of written and audiovisual materials that embody the language. This essay will examine the essential role of digital preservation in maintaining Papiamento’s vitality, discuss the broader implications for language preservation in the digital age, and highlight the joint efforts of the Aruban heritage community and the Internet Archive in making this a reality.\n\n\n\nPapiamento is a Creole language spoken primarily in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, blending elements from Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and African languages, as well as indigenous Arawak. It is a vital part of the cultural identity in these regions, serving as a unique linguistic bridge that reflects the diverse historical influences of the Caribbean. Papiamento is not just a means of communication, but a symbol of resilience and cultural pride for its speakers.\n\n\n\nWith Papiamento being a relatively small and regional language, publications in Papiamento are characterized by small print runs, limited availability beyond libraries in the long term, apart from the financial and logistical factors usually associated with small-scale (island) society and (relative) geographic remoteness.\n\n\n\nAnd although the language is very much alive, very resilient, and widely spoken, it is not commercially viable or interesting for international markets. Such is (or was) the case for Papiamento in a digital sense as well: the smaller the language, the longer it takes for a language to be supported or included in software or online products. \n\n\n\nBut the tide seems to be changing: Launched in 2019, the National Library of Aruba’s online collection (hosted by the Internet Archive), has grown into a veritable National Collection effort called Coleccion Aruba with over a dozen partner institutions, from Aruba and beyond, providing access to handwritten, printed and audiovisual works in seven languages, including \n\n\n\nthe largest online text corpus for the Papiamento language, spanning over a million digitized and digital-born pages. Using this growing Papiamento text corpus, Large Language AI Models (LLMs) like ChatGTP can now converse and answer in Papiamento/u, and Papiamento/u is now a supported language in both Meta’s AI-assisted “No Language Left Behind” initiative and Google Translate. And just recently in January 2024, the Council of Europe recognized Papiamento as an official European minority language, after having been officialized in Aruba in 2003 and in Curacao and Bonaire in 2007.\n\n\n\nDownload the complete Vanishing Culture report.\n\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence has made quite an impact in the world of documentary heritage, with one of the newest developments being handwritten text recognition (HTR).With new technologies like the AI-supported Transkribus, HTR technologies are becoming available not only to the bigger institutions in wealthy nations, but also to small island institutions such as Biblioteca Nacional Aruba (the Aruba National Library) and Archivo Nacional Aruba (the Aruba National Archives), which adopted this new technology at a relatively early stage in 2019. The ability to add  text layers to scanned manuscripts unlocked documentary treasure chests containing centuries of written records, correspondence, and prose—all within the reach of the Aruba institutions. \n\n\n\nAfter a pilot project in 2022–2023, called “Coleccion Aruba,” between the Internet Archive, the National Library of Aruba, and the National Archives of Aruba, the Aruba subcollection of the Internet Archive became one of the first online platforms where full-text search for handwritten documents was made available. This functionality was completely integrated into its full-text search capabilities, with words and phrases in centuries-old documents becoming just as easy to find as words and phrases written down or spoken as part of the current news cycle. Few (commercial) archival platforms offer full-text search for handwritten sources separately, let alone fully integrated or at no cost, like the Internet Archive does.\n\n\n\nIn April 2024, the Internet Archive, together with their Aruban partners, announced plans to attempt to digitize all works published in the Papiamento language, enlarging the online footprint of the Papiamento language even more, starting with the works held by Biblioteca Nacional Aruba in their National and special collections. These works will be digitized in-house by the institutions themselves, and to assist in this effort, the Internet Archive has pledged to send a book scanner to the island to increase the scanning capacity on the island. After having visited their new Coleccion Aruba partners, the Internet Archive—together with Aruban national broadcaster Telearuba— have also joined forces to digitally preserve all contents of Telearuba’s livestream and TV offerings. Once combined with the aforementioned future automatic captioning support for Papiamento, thousands of hours of Aruba’s audiovisual heritage will also be opened up for full-text search, for further research and for use in Aruba’s education system, which is currently transitioning from a colonial-era education system completely taught in Dutch to a multilingual model mother tongue-based education system.\n\n\n\nDuring the global COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online resources and demand for digital access to information increased greatly: online access was not just expected, but became a basic necessity and a direct life-line for many people. Luckily, with Aruba being a small-scale society like, the library was able to meet this increased demand by rapidly operationalizing the “short lines” that exist between them and local book authors and publishers, by making available crucial resources, such as Papiamento language literary works and essential resources like daily newspapers —free of cost, to not only Aruban students, but also to the general public.\n\n\n\nThe momentum set into action in 2020 still has not slowed down; rather, it seems to be increasing. More and more local authors choose to forego all the increasing costs typically associated with print publishing, instead choosing to publish directly to the online Aruba Collection and the Internet Archive. Aruba’s efforts to digitize and preserve its culture and documentary heritage have piqued the interest of more international audiences as well, with other (Dutch) Caribbean island nations and territories showing interest in replicating the model implemented in Aruba, and with media outlets like Wired, The Verge, and PBS News Weekend, as well as regional news outlets like Antilliaans Dagblad and Caribisch Netwerk, also dedicating attention to the “Aruba story.” For example, Wired author Kate Knibbs even mentioned during a recent Slate podcast that she suspected Aruba’s digital preservation efforts being part of  “a really effective guerilla tourism campaign […] aimed at dorks.“\n\n\n\nAll things considered, future prospects look encouraging: Aruba’s institutions and the Internet Archive are in it for the long haul, and even intend to expand their efforts beyond the white shores of sunny Aruba.\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nPeter Scholing is a digital librarian, researcher and information scientist working for Biblioteca Nacional Aruba, Aruba’s National Library.

The report details recent instances of cultural loss, highlights the underlying causes, and emphasizes the critical role that public-serving libraries and archives must play in preserving these materials for future generations. By empowering libraries and archives legally, culturally, and financially, we can safeguard the public’s ability to maintain access to our cultural history and our digital future.\n\n\n\nDownload Vanishing Culture: A Report on Our Fragile Cultural Record"}]
